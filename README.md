# Vero-Lang
A programming language created using C/C++ - with syntax inspired from (you guessed it) C/C++ (and some elements of Python and JavaScript)! Mainly built as a proof of concept and to further understand how lexical tokenization, parsing, abstract syntax trees, interpreters, etcetera work!
