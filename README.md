# Vero-Lang
A programming language created using C/C++ - with syntax inspired from (you guessed it) C/C++ (and some elements of Python and JavaScript)! Mainly built as a proof of concept and to further understand how lexical tokenization, parsing, abstract syntax trees, interpreters, etcetera work! 

Oh and the name *Vero* comes from the Italian word for **true**. The idea was for this to be a *true and honest language* - if the syntax looks simple, the language should be as well! There is absolutely 0 hidden complexity - the language is exactly what it looks like!

## :question: How to run?
There are two ways to run the language:
1. **Online Interpreter _(for most users)_:** If you are just looking to test things out, click [here](https://deoshreyas.github.io/Vero-Lang/) for the online interpeter (I ported the C/C++ code to Web Assembly to make this work!)
2. **Local Usage:** If you are interested in the source code - please download the [Source](https://github.com/deoshreyas/Vero-Lang/tree/main/Source) and compile it locally using a C/C++ compiler (like the GNU C++ compiler!)

## :warning: A word of advice 
If you couldn't already tell - this is a hobby project! It is not meant to be taken seriously - I made it for the sole purpose of furthering my understanding. You should probably not use it for any serious projects. 

## :closed_book: Syntax Documentation
Inspired by the simplicity of C++ braces ({...}), the optional nature of semicolons in JavaScript (;), and the overall ease of usage of Python! Click [here](deoshreyas.github.io/Vero-Lang/docs.html) for the syntax documentation.
